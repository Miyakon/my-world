    - title: 'Canadian Charms'
      text: |
        Here industry is not in vain,
        For we have bounteous crops ofgrain,
        And you behold on every field
        Of grass and roots abundant yield,
        But after all the greatest charm
        Is the snug home upon the farm,
        And stone walls now keep cattle warm.
    - title: 'Motto'
      text: |
        Politeness, Perseverance and pluck,
        To their possessor will bring good luck.
